## Introduction 

- Basics of webscraping with rvest. 
- Web scraping is used to extract data from webpages. Some websites will offer API, a set of structureed HTTP requests that return data as JSON.

## Ethics and Legalities

- If the data is public, non-personal and factual, it is likely okay.
- A good practice is to wait a little between each scraping request between pages. One easy way to do so is to use the `polite` package
- Many website contain a "terms and conditions" or "terms of service" if you read that closely it most likely will specify 
- Be sure not to scrape personal identifuiable information like names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, etc. 
- Copyright, data is not under copyright protection as long it is apps

## HTML Basics

- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- Hierachical structure by elements that start with a tag `<tag>`, optional attributes `id = 'first'` and an end tag like `</tag>` and contents everything between the start and end taG

```{r eval = FALSE}
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id='first'>A heading</h1>
  <p>Some text &amp; <b>some bold text.</b></p>
  <img src='myimg.png' width='100' height='100'>
</body>
```

- Since < and > are used for tags, you have to use escapes sucks as `&gt` (greater than) and `&lt` (less than)

**Elements**

- Every pafe must be in an `<html>` element and have two children `<head>` and `<body>`
- `<body>` contains the informaiton you see in the browser
- There is also block tags `<h1>` (heading 1), `<section>` (section), `<p>` (paragraph) and `<ol>` (ordered lists), `<li>` (list item), `<ul>` (unordered lists)
- incline tags like `<b>` (bold), `<i>` (italics) and `<a>`

Here is an example that shows a paragraph which a single word in bold

```{r eval = FALSE}
<p>
  Hi! My <b>name</b> is Hadley.
</p>
```


## Extracting Data

1. you will need the URL of the page you what to scrape
2. read in the html into r with `read_html()`. This returns and `xml_document()`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

html <- read_html("http://rvest.tidyverse.org/")
html
```

Withing rvest there is a function that lets you write HTML inline. Here is an example:
```{r}
html <- minimal_html("
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a bulleted list</li>
  </ul>
")
html
```


- CSS is short for cascading style sheets, a tool for defining the visual styling. 

- There is a miniature language for selecting elements on a page called CSS selectors. 

- CSS selectors find patterns for locating html elements. 
  - `p` selects all `<p>` elements 
  - `.title` selects all emelents with class "title"
  - `#title` selects the elemnt with the `id` attribute = "title"
  
Here is a simple example

```{r}
html <- minimal_html("
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p id='first'>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p class='important'>This is an important paragraph</p>
")
```

Using `html_elements()`

```{r}
html |> html_elements("p")

html |> html_elements(".important")

html |> html_elements("#first")
```
There is also `html_elements()` that has the same number of inputs and outputs

```{r}
html |> html_element("p")
```

The difference between the `html_element()` and `html_elements()` is that when you use a selector than returns no elements, `element` will return missing value and `elements` will have a vector of 0 length

### Nesting Selections 

In most cases, you’ll use `html_elements()` and `html_element()` together, typically using `html_elements()` to identify elements that will become observations then using `html_element()` to find elements that will become variables.

Here is inofrmation on different star wars characters

```{r}
html <- minimal_html("
  <ul>
    <li><b>C-3PO</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>167 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>R4-P17</b> is a <i>droid</i></li>
    <li><b>R2-D2</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>96 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>Yoda</b> weighs <span class='weight'>66 kg</span></li>
  </ul>
  ")
```


```{r}
characters <- html |> html_elements("li")
characters
```

To extract the name of each character, we use `html_element()`, because when applied to the output of `html_elements()` it’s guaranteed to return one response per element:

```{r}
characters |> html_element("b")
```
```{r}
characters |> html_element(".weight")


characters |> html_elements(".weight")

```

With the second output you see that we lose the connection between names and weights. 

## Text and Attributes

The function `html_text2()` etracts the plain text.

```{r}
characters |> 
  html_element("b") |> 
  html_text2()

characters |> 
  html_element(".weight") |> 
  html_text2()
```

While the function `html_attr()` extracts data from attributes. It will always return a string, sp numbers and dates will need post processing.

```{r}
html <- minimal_html("
  <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat'>cats</a></p>
  <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog'>dogs</a></p>
")

html |> 
  html_elements("p") |> 
  html_element("a") |> 
  html_attr("href")
```

### Tables

- If we get lucky the data will be stored in an HTML table and we will just need to read it.
- Table Elements
  - `<table>` table
  - `<tr>` table row
  - `<th>` table heading
  - `<td>` table data

Here’s a simple HTML table with two columns and three rows:
We will use the function `html_table()` to read in the table

```{r}
html <- minimal_html("
  <table class='mytable'>
    <tr><th>x</th>   <th>y</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1.5</td> <td>2.7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4.9</td> <td>1.3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7.2</td> <td>8.1</td></tr>
  </table>
  ")

html |> 
  html_element(".mytable") |>  #idenifies table of choice aka name
  html_table()
```
Above it was able to convert into numbers but this is not always the case. We can use `convert = FALSE` to negate this and then do post processing.


### Questions

Is class just naming the specific element?


## Finding the right selectors

- Selectgadget is a javascript bookmarklet that automatically generates CSS selectors based on the positibe and negative examples that you provide.
- Chrome has the best web developer tools, right clock on an element on the page and click `inspect`.


## Putting it all together 

We will use the `vignette("starwars")`

This will return the 7 moveis on the page, suggesting that using `section` was a good selector
```{r}
url <- "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html"
html <- read_html(url)

section <- html |> html_elements("section")
section
```

```{r}

# will find the titles
section |> 
  html_element("h2") |> 
  html_text2()

# name of directors
section |>
  html_element(".director") |> 
  html_text2()

```

 Once we do that for each compnenet we wrap it in a tibble like:
 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)



tibble(
  title = section |> 
    html_element("h2") |> 
    html_text2(),
  released = section |> 
    html_element("p") |> 
    html_text2() |> 
    str_remove("Released: ") |> 
    parse_date(),
  director = section |> 
    html_element(".director") |> 
    html_text2()
)
```
 



The next example we will use the top 250 movies 

```{r, eval= FALSE}

url <- "https://web.archive.org/web/20220201012049/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/"

html <- read_html(url)

table <- html |> 
  html_element("table") |> 
  html_table()
table
```


The table loaded in well but we need to rename columns to make them easier to work with.

```{r eval= FALSE}
ratings <- table |>
  select(
    rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
    rating = `IMDb Rating`
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    rank_title_year = str_replace_all(rank_title_year, "\n +", " ")
  ) |> 
  separate_wider_regex(
    rank_title_year,
    patterns = c(
      rank = "\\d+", "\\. ",
      title = ".+", " +\\(",
      year = "\\d+", "\\)"
    )
  )
ratings
```



```{r}
html |> 
  html_elements("td strong") |> 
  head() |> 
  html_attr("title")

```

```{r eval = FALSE}
ratings |>
  mutate(
    rating_n = html |> html_elements("td strong") |> html_attr("title")
  ) |> 
  separate_wider_regex(
    rating_n,
    patterns = c(
      "[0-9.]+ based on ",
      number = "[0-9,]+",
      " user ratings"
    )
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    number = parse_number(number)
  )
```



Remember `html_elements()` returns what you see in the brower.


Sometimes you'll hit a site where `html_elements()` and friends don't return anything you see in the browser. Many times this is due to it being written in javascript and rvest only reads im html.
